# CME3204_Homework
This project is a Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) simulation created with Cisco Packet Tracer for our university coursework in CME 3204: Data Communications and Computer Networks. The model connects two branch offices via an ISP, incorporating a server farm and various end-user devices to simulate and analyze network traffic scenarios.
